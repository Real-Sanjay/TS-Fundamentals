📘 Introduction to TypeScript
When working with JavaScript, you’ve likely enjoyed its flexibility — variables can hold any type, and functions can accept all sorts of values. But with that flexibility comes potential for bugs that are only caught at runtime. This is where TypeScript steps in.


🆚 Dynamic vs Static Typing
Programming languages fall into two categories:

Dynamically typed: Like JavaScript, where variables can hold any type and change at runtime.

Statically typed: Like TypeScript or Go, where each variable has a fixed type and errors can be caught during compilation.


For example, JavaScript allows this:

let score = 100;
score = "high"; // No error in JS
But TypeScript will catch this:


let score: number = 100;
score = "high"; // ❌ Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

How Typing Affects Execution
Dynamic typing (JavaScript): Uses interpreters, executes code line-by-line, and catches errors only when the code is actually run.

Static typing (TypeScript): Uses compilers, analyzes the entire code before running, catching type-related issues early — before your app breaks in production.


What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It’s a superset of JavaScript, meaning every valid JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program — but with extra superpowers like static typing and modern tooling support.

TypeScript = JavaScript + Types


It allows developers to:
Define the types of variables, parameters, return values, and more.
Catch bugs early during development (compile time).
Get better editor support, like IntelliSense, auto-completions, and inline docs.
Make code more predictable, maintainable, and robust, especially in large projects.


🌟 Why TypeScript?
Here are some benefits that make TypeScript a go-to for modern JavaScript development:

✅ Compile-time error checking: Avoid silly bugs and prevent runtime crashes.
✅ Self-documenting code: Types make it easier to understand what a function expects and returns.
✅ Better tooling: Works seamlessly with modern editors like VS Code to give rich editing experience.
✅ Scalability: Perfect for large codebases and team collaboration.
✅ Popular among big companies: Adopted by industry giants like Microsoft, Google, Airbnb, and more.
